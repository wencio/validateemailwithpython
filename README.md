# validateemailwithpython


**Title:** Email Payload Validator

**Description:**

This Python code provides a set of functions to validate various components of an email payload, including sender and receiver information, HTML content, and replacement tags.

**Functions:**

1. `validate_name(name: str, min_length: int, max_length: int) -> None`: Validates a name according to specified rules, including minimum and maximum length constraints. Raises `ValueError` on validation failure.

2. `validate_email_addr(email_addr: str) -> bool`: Validates an email address according to email specification rules, including length limits, character validation, and TLD validation. Raises `ValueError` on validation failure.

3. `validate_html(html: str) -> None`: Validates HTML content to ensure it's not empty. Raises `ValueError` if the content is empty.

4. `validate_replacements(html: str, replacements: Dict) -> None`: Validates replacement tags in HTML and associated replacement values. Ensures that replacements are non-empty and match the tags in the HTML. Checks for surplus replacement keys not used in the HTML.

5. `validate_email_payload(sender_name: str, sender_addr: str, receiver_name: str, receiver_addr: str, html: str, replacements: Dict) -> bool`: Validates an email payload, including sender and receiver information, HTML content, and replacements. Raises `ValueError` on validation failure.

**Usage:**

You can use these functions to validate email payloads before sending them to ensure they adhere to specified rules and constraints. Any validation failure will raise a `ValueError` with descriptive error messages.

**Note:**

This code is designed for basic email payload validation and may require further customization to meet specific project requirements.
